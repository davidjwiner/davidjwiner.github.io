Hey dear readers, a couple of updates. First, I finished up my data science gig at Pure over the summer and started this fall as an MBA student at Stanford. We're on the quarter system here, and the first quarter (of six) is actually almost done, which means that I have read nearly one sixth of *How to Make Friends and Influence People*. <!--more-->

Second, I decided that it was high time to get started with a project I've been meaining to put together for at least the last six months: **my ice cream map**. The current version has nine of my favorite scoop shops from around the country. Frankly, I was hoping for 10 shops since 10 is a nice, round number. Alas, I could not think of another one that was quite on the same level as these nine, and I didn't want to force it.

The locations are not explicitly ranked on the map, but it's crucial to note that **not all ice cream is created equal**. Far and away my favorite ice cream place in the country is [**Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams**](https://jenis.com/scoop-shops/12-south/). It's actually a chain that is based in Columbus, OH, but I tried one their Nashville locations where I snapped a photo of their Brambleberry Crisp flavor.  It was astonishingly tasty. Incredibly smooth, just the right amount of tart flavor, and served with a delightful wafer cookie on the side.

Lastly, I feel the need to preempt some criticism from my other frozen dessert-loving fans. This is not an equal opportunity ice cream map. I have nothing against frozen yogurt or vegan desserts. Frankly, I am an enormous fan of [FoMu](http://www.fomuicecream.com/), a punny ("faux moo") vegan dessert shop in Boston's South End neighborhood. The frozen desserts there are generally coconut based. It's a different category of dessert, though, and I felt it would be unfair to compare to the real deal. Hence we're going to be purists in this map.

*I would love to hear your feedback on my map or this blog more generally! Please drop me a line in the comments.*
