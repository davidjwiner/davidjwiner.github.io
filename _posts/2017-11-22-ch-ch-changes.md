Hey dear readers, a couple of updates. First, I finished up my data science gig at Pure over the summer and started this fall as an MBA student at Stanford. We're on the quarter system here, and the first quarter (of six) is actually almost done, which means that I have read nearly one sixth of *How to Make Friends and Influence People*. <!--more-->

Second, I decided that it was high time to get started with a project I've been meaining to put together for at least the last six months: **my ice cream map**. The current version has nine of my favorite scoop shops from around the country. Frankly, I was hoping for 10 shops. 10 is a nice, round number. Alas, I could not think of another one that was quite on the same level as these nine, and I didn't want to force it.

So, without further ado, behold.

A couple of important notes:

### The ice cream map is a living document

I certainly hope that, over the next two years of school, I'll be able to find a number of additional locations to add to this map. If that is not the case, I will likely move back to NYC in search of more ice cream. If you have any places you'd recommend in the SF Bay Area, let me know and so I can give them a try! Who knows, maybe they'll even make it onto the map someday.

### Not all ice cream is created equal

Far and away my favorite ice cream place in the country is [**Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams**](https://jenis.com/scoop-shops/12-south/). It's actually a chain that is based in Columbus, OH, but I tried one their Nashville locations where I snapped the above photo of their Brambleberry Crisp flavor. It was astonishingly tasty. Incredibly smooth, just the right amount of tart flavor, and served with a delightful wafer cookie on the side. 

### This is not an equal opportunity ice cream map

I have nothing against frozen yogurt or vegan desserts. Frankly, I am an enormous fan of [FoMu](http://www.fomuicecream.com/), a punny ("faux moo") vegan dessert shop in Boston's South End neighborhood. The frozen desserts there are generally coconut based. It's a different category of dessert, though, and I felt it would be unfair to compare to the real deal. Hence we're going dairy only in this map.

*I would love to hear your feedback on my map or this blog more generally! Please drop me a line in the comments.*
