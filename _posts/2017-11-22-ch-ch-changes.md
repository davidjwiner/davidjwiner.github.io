Hey fam, couple of updates. First, I finished up as a data scientist at Pure over the summer and started this fall as an MBA student at Stanford Graduate School of Business. We're on the quarter system here, and the first quarter is actually already almost done. <!--more-->

Second, I decided that it was high time to get started with a project I've been meaining to put together for at least the last six months: my ice cream map. The current version has 9 of my favorite scoop shops from around the country. Frankly, I was hoping for 10 shops. 10 is a nice, round number. Alas, I could not think of another one that was quite on the same level as these 9, and I didn't want to force it.

So without further ado, behold:

A couple of important notes:

### The ice cream map is a living document

I certainly hope that, over the next two years of school, I'll be able to find a number of additional locations to add to this map. If you have any you'd recommend in the SF Bay Area, let me know and so I can give it a try (and maybe even add it to the list one day)!

### Not all ice cream is created equal

Far and away my favorite ice cream place in the country is [**Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams**](https://jenis.com/scoop-shops/12-south/). It's actually a chain that is based in Columbus, OH, but I tried one their Nashville location where I snapped the above photo of their Brambleberry Crisp flavor. It was astonishingly tasty. Incredibly smooth, just the right amount of tart flavor, and served with a delightful wafer cookie on the side. 

### Other frozen dessert shops are not included

I have nothing against frozen yogurt or vegan dessert places. Frankly, I am an enormous fan of [FoMu](http://www.fomuicecream.com/), a punny vegan dessert shop in Boston's South End. The frozen desserts there are generally coconut based. It's a different category of dessert, though, and I felt it would be unfair to compare.
