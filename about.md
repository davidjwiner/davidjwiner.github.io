![Me](/assets/David.jpg)

My name is **David**, and I'm a Masters student studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. My Masters research centers on natural language processing applied to intellectual property and US patent data.

Prior to coming to Berkeley, I worked in management consulting at [**Bain**](http://bain.com/) and in product at [**Zearn**](https://www.zearn.org/). I studied Applied Math at Brown for undergrad.

My interests have shifted a lot over the last few years--there are often more things I'd like to learn about or work on than I have time to--but here are some of the things that I find myself thinking about a lot:

- Machine learning and AI
- K-12 math education
- Databases
- Intellectual property and patent invalidation
- Enterpreneurship
- Vegetarian cooking
- Statistics
- US politics
