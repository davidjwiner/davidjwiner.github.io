![Me](/assets/David.jpg)

My name is David, and I live in San Francisco. I work at Google as a Product Manager on the [Kotlin programming language](https://www.kotlinlang.org) and its tooling for [Android](https://developer.android.com/kotlin). I occasionally blog here but have largely moved my thoughts over to [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/davidjwiner).
