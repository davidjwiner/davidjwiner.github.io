![Me](/assets/David.jpg)

My name is **David**, and I'm a first-year MBA student at Stanford.

Prior to coming to Stanford, I worked in management consulting at [**Bain**](http://bain.com/), product at [**Zearn**](https://www.zearn.org/), and data science at [**Pure Storage**](http://www.purestorage.com/). I studied Applied Math at Brown for undergrad and did my Masters in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley, where I worked on developing machine learning algorithms for patent analysis.

My interests have shifted a lot over the last few years, but here are some of the things that I have found myself thinking about recently:

- Machine learning and AI
- Financial inclusion and tools for small business owners
- K-12 math education
- Vegetarian cooking
- Statistics
- US politics

Feel free to shoot me a note or reach out over [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-winer-58223428) if you'd like to get in touch.
