![Me](/assets/David.jpg)

My name is **David**, and I'm a Masters student studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. My research centers on Natural Language Processing applied to intellectual property and US patent data.

Prior to coming to Berkeley, I worked in management consulting at [**Bain**](http://bain.com/) and in product at [**Zearn**](https://www.zearn.org/). I did my undergraduate work in Applied Math at Brown.
