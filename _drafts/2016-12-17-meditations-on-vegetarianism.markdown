Meditations on vegetarianism and ethical capital
================================================

I recently ate out with an omnivore friend of mine who asked me before we ordered if I was okay with him having steak for dinner. His question took me by surprise because people almost never ask me---in my mind, it was akin to my asking him if I could order noodles. It wasn't my decision to make for him, so I responded, "Of course! Order what you want." That interaction stuck with me, though, because it made me think about what role I have in influencing the choices my friends and family make.

My decision to be vegetarian is rooted in my personal system of ethics: I refrain from eating meat since doing substantially limits my carbon footprint. The effects of this decision have been better documented by other, more knowledgeable people, so I'll list just a couple of quick facts:

- Meat factory farming is the __number one__ source of carbon emissions in the US, ahead of the entire transportation industry
- ...

 Clearly, I think I've made a choice that I believe to be correct by my own personal sense of morality. My friend's question made me wonder, though, do I have have an obligation to proselytize that choice? I can't help but conclude that the answer to this question is yes.

<!--   If I make an ethical choice, though, what right or obligation do I have to proselytize that choice? I've tried to think about this by drawing analogies to other choices I have made that I believe have moral implications.
 -->
<!-- For example, in spite of being a staunch Democrat, I never phone banked for Hillary Clinton during the presidential election. I have many friends who routinely asked me to volunteer my time. The tone that accompanied those invitations grew stronger over the course of the campaign. Towards the end, these requests felt less like light invitations and more like ethical appeals: if you believe that a Trump presidency would have disastrous effects on our country's social, economic, and foreign policy , the message went, you have an obligation to do everything you can to prevent it. I'm inclined to believe this argument, and it's part of what makes me feel guilty for not having done my part to prevent Trump's election. -->

<!-- Now back to eating meat. I've made a decision that I believe is morally correct. Should I now try to convince others to make that same choice? Even more strongly, do I have an ethical obligation to convince others to make the same choice? I think the answer to both of these questions is yes.

An analogy
----------

There's a great hypothetical scenario in practical ethics called the drowning child problem. I'm likely going to butcher it, but here goes:

*Imagine you are walking by a river on a hot summer day and see a small child---perhaps only two or three years old---struggling to stay afloat. He is by himself and calling out for help. You could swim out into the water and him from drowning but are wearing your favorite pair of leather pants (it's beyond me why you chose to wear leather pants on a hot summer day, but that was your decision, not mine). Wading into the water to save the child would almost certainly ruin them. So what choice do you make: do you save the child or your pants?*

Most people respond to this problem with an enthusiastic, "save the child!" Now, the application of this analogy to vegetarianism is somewhat controversial. What vegetarians would say is that, (1) many people are already suffering (and many more will) as a result of climate change and (2) choosing not to eat meat is a mild inconvenience but not a huge sacrifice---perhaps on par with ruining your favorite pair of pants. (Note: thanks to Peter Singer for these arguments.) 

Still, many reasonable people disagree that they are directly responsible for (1) and believe that (2) sets up a false comparison---giving up meat is actually a much greater sacrifice than ruining one's leather pants. Let's accept that other people hold these views, but I---and many other vegetarians---do not. The drowning child analogy, for us, is an apt one, which is why we do not eat meat.

Now let's propose a modification to the original problem: suppose you are not yourself next to the river wearing the leather pants. Instead, it it is your friend who happens to be on the phone with you when he sees the child drowning. He describes the scenario to you and tells you he's thinking of letting the child drown since he _really_ likes those leather pants and it's not like he knows the child---why is it his responsibility? The question is then: do you have an obligation to at least try to persuade your friend otherwise? To change his mind, ruin the pants, and save the child? To act in line with your system of ethics instead of his? I think the answer is clearly yes.

So this isn't really a blog post about the ethics of vegetarianism. I think it's more a blog post about the ethics of standing by while your friends and loved ones make ethical decisions with which you disagree. I think it's pretty clear that, at least for decisions that have major ethical implications (e.g., like who to vote for, whether or not to eat meat, etc.), standing by and saying nothing makes you at least somewhat complicit in the outcomes of those decisions.

A caveat
--------

Now, I know I and many of my vegetarian friends recoil at the idea of becoming the food police, constantly nagging their friends and family at every meal. First, we ourselves aren't perfect---I'm not vegan, for example, and I'm writing these words on a cross-country flight. Clearly, I am not doing everything I can to shrink my carbon footprint. Second, and perhaps more importantly, we vegetarians feel that we don't want to damage our relationships with our friends and loved ones. In addition to the arguably selfish desire for friendship and to be well-liked, I think that there is  also a moral justification for this latter impulse. 

I often hear people speak about the somewhat vague notion of social capital, but I think there's an even more important---and related---concept: ethical capital. The idea is simple: there is a fixed extent to which you can nudge the people in your life to make choices that align with your conception of morality. Everyone has that friend who never lets up---the constant detractor who criticizes just about every choice you make. No listens to this person because it is impossible to live up to his standards---he is spread too thin.

 I'd suggest that maintaining your ethical capital matters because it allows you to provide influence when it really matters. I think a lot of young progressives realized this during the 2016 presidential election: they went to work on their friends and family---often painfully straining their personal relationships---in attempt to prevent the Trump disaster. It unfortunately did not work, but I believe that a similar lens can be applied to many different types of choices.

It is this lens that I have started to apply to my own vegetarianism. I used to think that it was not my place to tell others what food choices they should make. After all, these are some of the most personal decisions people make, and they are often deeply influenced by one's upbringing and culture. Still, it's hard to think of another major life decision I've made that I so completely believe in. I hope to start engaging on this topic more with friends and family---doing away with my fear that they will find the topic uncomfortable. They may very well find it uncomfortable, but maybe, at least for a little while, that's okay.
